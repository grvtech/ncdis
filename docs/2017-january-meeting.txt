CDIS changes suggestions:  

1- Add text of disclaimer to “notes”

   “The Notes section in CDIS is provided to share information between HCPs.   The CDIS Patient 

Notes does not replace documentation in the chart.  The CDIS is not a medicolegal document.”



2- Add a pop up option  if a note is written, to ensure the receiver sees it.   And a “file” option 

when the note has been seen.  




3-  Make top window with demographics smaller, to create increase focus and space on graphs.  Or 

readjust GUI to make graphs wider…  



4- In Glu section– have table open  as default  for both A1C and glu – check w Charlie 




5- Cramped dates on graphs, make dates hard to read.   Either make max of 5 yrs data,   or   change 

format of dates (to two lines   01-             instead of one line that is cramped   (01-2017)

                                                     2017 



6- When search for patient,  no order of charts when searching by chart #.   i.e  chart 27 (RAMQ 

FLOO)  hard to find,  shows up after multiple other charts.      Chart start with the lowest chart # 

to the highest ,   if possible) 



7- In the large graph of all Glu results ,  the target and normal values are reversed..



8- In all the glu graphs,  the highest value at the top of the graph ,  the value is often not included.

     (i.e.  chart # 686)  - solutioin – add 10% padding on top value



9- How is PCR upload doing?  Please send David email on who contacted and when,  



10- Edit patient page -  medic to MD

Report on Albuminuria -  by ACR and PCR ,  and groups ( 


ACR < 2.0 or PCR < 3.0 mg/mmol   = normal ,   
ACR 2.0-20  or  PCR 3.0 – 30     = microalbuminuria ,    
ACR 20.1 – 70 ,   PCR 30 – 100   = overt proteinuria,
